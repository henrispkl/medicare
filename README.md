Medicare
======

A fictional freelancing platform for healthcare workers. It's my first project using the MERN stack.


## How to run

**Backend:**
It needs a `.env` file with the parameters `PORT` and `DATABASE_URL` with the MongoDB connection string. Then, just nagivate to the folder and start it with the `npm start` command.

    cd backend/
    npm start


**Frontend:** Same thing for the backend, just run the `npm start` command on the folder.

    cd frontend/
    npm start
