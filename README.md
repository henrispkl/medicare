Medicare
======

A fictional freelancing platform for healthcare workers. It's my first project using the MERN stack.


## How to install and run

Simply run `npm install` on the root folder of the project and it will install all dependencies for both backend and frontend. To run the project, use `npm start`.


## Roadmap

* Edit job page
* Edit nurse/doctor page
* Frontend: login authentication and route protection
