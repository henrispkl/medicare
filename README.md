Medicare
======

A fictional freelancing platform for healthcare workers. It's my first project using the MERN stack.


## How to install and run

Simply run `npm install` on the root folder of the project and it will install all dependencies for both backend and frontend. To run the project, use `npm start`.


## Roadmap

* Frontend: route protection
