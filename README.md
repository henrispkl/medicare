Medicare
======

A fictional freelancing platform for healthcare workers. It's my first project using the MERN stack.


## How to run

Simply run `npm install` on the root folder of the project and it will install all dependencies for both backend and frontend.

## Roadmap

* Edit job page
* Edit nurse/doctor page
* Register and login page
* Frontend: JWT authentication
