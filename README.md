Medicare
======

A fictional freelancing platform for healthcare workers. It's my first project using the MERN stack.


## How to run

**Backend:**
It needs a `.env` file with the parameters `PORT` and `DATABASE_URL` with the MongoDB connection string. Then, just nagivate to the folder, install the modules with `npm install` and start the project with the `npm start` command.

    cd backend/
    npm install
    npm start


**Frontend:** Same thing for the backend, just install everything with `npm install` then run the `npm start` command on the folder.

    cd frontend/
    npm install
    npm start

## Roadmap
